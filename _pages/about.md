I'm a MS student at UC San Diego. I obtained my B.S. from Nanjing University, advised by Professor Lu.

I have broad research interests within <strong>AI generative models, Audio/Speech/Language/Music and parallel computing</strong>, as well as deep learning system and machine learning theory.

Currently I'm carrying on an internship in Bose Corporation as audio machine learning engineer.

Recently, Iâ€™m conducting research in several areas:
- I'm working on parallel optimization methods under the guidance of [Professor Wang](https://jimwang123.github.io/)
- I'm working on diffusion large language model in symbolic music generation with the help from [Jingyue](https://yuer867.github.io/).

Prior to this, I completed an internship as an AI Engineer at [Papergames/Infold Games](https://www.papegames.com/en).
