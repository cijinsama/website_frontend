I am an ambitious Acoustics undergraduate at Nanjing University, fortunate to be under the expert guidance of Professor. Lu as I embark on my undergraduate thesis, delving into the realm of audio packet loss concealment. Stay tuned as I prepare to unveil our [demo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _demos/speech-enhancement.md %}), showcasing our innovative solutions.

My research interests span a wide spectrum, encompassing <strong>AI generative models, speech signal processing and parallel computing</strong>. While I have made initial forays into these areas, I am eager to dive deeper, particularly in domains such as system, program analysis and machine learning theory. Currently, I am also leveraging my skills as an AI Engineer through an enriching internship at [Papergames](https://www.papegames.com/en).

Looking ahead, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities for the 2025 summer, with a primary focus on audio and speech AI technology. Reach out to me via the email provided on the left :)

I am also actively engaged in a [game development studio](https://github.com/Rice-Time-Studio) that I co-founded with friends. Together, we channel our creativity and passion into crafting unique gaming experiences during our spare time.
