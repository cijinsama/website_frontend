I'm an incoming MS student at UC San Diego. I will obtain my B.S. from Nanjing University in June, 2024, advised by Professor Lu. Stay tuned as I prepare to unveil our [demo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _demos/speech-enhancement.md %}).

I have broad research interests within <strong>AI generative models, speech signal processing and parallel computing</strong>, as well as deep learning system, program analysis, and machine learning theory.

Currently, I am leveraging my skills as an AI Engineer through an enriching internship at [Papergames](https://www.papegames.com/en).

Looking ahead, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities for the 2025 summer, with a focus on audio and speech AI technology. Reach out to me via the email provided on the left :)

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also actively engaged in a [game development studio](https://github.com/Rice-Time-Studio) that I co-founded with friends. Together, we channel our creativity and passion into crafting unique gaming experiences during our spare time.
