I am currently an undergraduate student in Acoustics at Nanjing University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Lu at Nanjing University for my undergraduate degree paper about audio packet loss concealment. (demo will be released soon.)


Currently I'm doing an intership at [Papergames](https://www.papegames.com/en) as Artifical Intelligence Engineer.


<font size="5"><strong>I'm actively seeking intership opportunities for 2025 summer, with a primary focus on audio and speech AI technology. Contact me via email at the left side bar is appreciated.</strong></font>
