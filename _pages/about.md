I'm a MS student at UC San Diego. I obtained my B.S. from Nanjing University, advised by Professor Lu. Stay tuned as I prepare to unveil our [demo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _demos/speech-enhancement.md %}).

I have broad research interests within <strong>AI generative models, Audio/Speech/Language and parallel computing</strong>, as well as deep learning system, program analysis, and machine learning theory.

I will join [Bose](https://www.bose.com) as Audio Machine Learning Engineer for summer internship in 2025.
Currently, Iâ€™m conducting research at the [La Jolla Institute for Immunology](https://www.lji.org/), working on interpretable machine learning algorithms with [Professor Tal Einav](https://www.lji.org/labs/einav-lab/).
Prior to this, I completed an internship as an AI Engineer at [Papergames/Infold Games](https://www.papegames.com/en).

Looking ahead, <strong>I'm actively seeking fulltime work opportunities from the 2026</strong>, with a focus on audio and speech AI technology. Reach out to me via the email provided on the left :)
