I am currently an undergraduate student in Acoustics at Nanjing University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Lu at Nanjing University for my undergraduate degree paper about audio packet loss concealment. (demo will be released soon.)


Currently I'm doing an intership at [Papergames](https://www.papegames.com/en) as Artifical Intelligence Engineer.


<font size="5"><strong>I'm actively seeking intership opportunities for 2025 summer, with a primary focus on audio and speech AI technology. Contact me via email at the left side bar is appreciated.</strong></font>

My research interests are broad, including AI generative models, speech signal processing and parallel computing. There are a lot of areas that I have only stepped a little but wishing to dive further like system, program analysis and machine learning theory.

I'm also involved in a [game development studio](https://github.com/Rice-Time-Studio) that my friends and I launched. We create our own games in our free time.
