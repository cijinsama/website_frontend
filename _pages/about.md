I'm a MS student at UC San Diego. I obtained my B.S. from Nanjing University, advised by Professor Lu.

I have broad research interests within <strong>AI generative models, Audio/Speech/Language and parallel computing</strong>, as well as deep learning system, program analysis, and machine learning theory.

Currently, Iâ€™m conducting research in several areas:
- I'm working on parallel optimization methods under the guidance of [Professor Wang](https://jimwang123.github.io/)
- I'm working on music generation with the help from [Jingyue](https://yuer867.github.io/).

Prior to this, I completed an internship as an AI Engineer at [Papergames/Infold Games](https://www.papegames.com/en).

<!--Looking ahead, <strong>I'm actively seeking fulltime work opportunities from the 2026</strong>, with a focus on audio and speech AI technology. Reach out to me via the email provided on the left :)-->
