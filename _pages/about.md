I am currently an undergraduate student in Acoustics at Nanjing University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Lu at Nanjing University for my [undergraduate degree paper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _demos/speech-enhancement.md %}) about audio packet loss concealment. 


Currently I'm doing an intership at [Papergames](https://www.papegames.com/en) as Artifical Intelligence Engineer.


<font size="5"><strong>I'm actively seeking intership opportunities for 2025 summer, with a primary focus on audio and speech AI technology. Contact me via email at the left side bar is appreciated.</strong></font>

My research interests are broad, including AI generative models, speech signal processing and parallel computing. There are a lot of areas that I have only stepped a little but wishing to dive further like system, program analysis and machine learning theory.

I'm also involved in a [game development studio](https://github.com/Rice-Time-Studio) that my friends and I launched. We create our own games in our free time.
